# awesome-ideas

ðŸ’¡ I constantly come up with ideas but I don't have enough time to build or validate them. 

This repo collects ideas I've had over time and that folks can pick up and implement. See the [open issues](https://github.com/giuseppeg/awesome-ideas/issues) for a [list of ideas](https://github.com/giuseppeg/awesome-ideas/issues).
